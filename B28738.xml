            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS humbly offered by the Company of Glaſs and Earthen Ware Sellers, in Anſwer to the Pot-Makers printed Reaſons for their Bill now Depending in this Honourable Houſe.</head>
            <head type="sub">The Firſt of their printed Reaſons is,</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>THat the Manufacture of Earthen Ware is of general uſe in private Families of all Conditions, and of abſolute neceſſity in divers Trades and Profeſſions, ſufficient Quantities whereof are, and with eaſe might be made at home, for ſupply of the whole Nation, in all reſpects as good as any Imported, the ſame having been fully Demonſtrated to the late King</hi> Charles, <hi>and King</hi> James <hi>the Second; who in Teſtimony of their Satisfaction therein, iſſued out their ſeveral Proclamations for the better putting the Statute againſt the Importation of ſuch Foreign Ware in Execution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> They never did, neither can they make ſuch Painted Earthen Ware as is Imported; And the Proclamations they mention were Clandeſtinely got (and the firſt of them was in the time of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars) without any notice given to the ſaid Company of Glaſs and Earthen Ware Sellers, and the Act they mention does not take notice of Earthen Ware.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>That the ſaid Manufacture is wholy made of</hi> Engliſh <hi>Materials, great Quantities of Tin, Lead, Clay, and Kelpe to a conſiderable Value being therein yearly uſed; and if the ſame were duly Encouraged, a much greater Conſumption would be had, the ſaid Art be Improved, and the Exportation and Vent thereof in Foreign Parts be Promoted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Far greater Quantities then are or could be here Conſumed of the ſaid Materials, are Exported to <hi>Holland, Germany, Spain, Portugall, Italy, Turkey, Genoa, Perſia,</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt Indies,</hi> to make the ſaid Wares ſo deſired to be Prohibited.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> The ſaid Materials do Pay Cuſtom, both at their Exportation and Importation, and all Earthen Ware now Imported pays Four Shillings in the Pound; and all ſuch Ware has conſtantly been Rated in the Book of Rates, and never pretended to be Prohibited till within theſe Twenty Years by the ſaid Proclamations ſo ſurreptitiouſly got.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That the ſaid Trade cannot be managed without great Numbers of Artificers and Labourers, ſo as ſeveral hundreds of Poor Families do wholy depend thereon, beſides the ſeveral Tradeſmen, as Brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, Maſons, Mill-Wrights, Coopers, Smiths, Watermen, Bargemen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who are frequently Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Matters relating thereto, to ſo great a Degree, That a full Moiety of what the Goods are ſold for, is paid and expended by the Maſter for Labour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> There are but Six or Seven of the ſaid Pot-Makers in <hi>England,</hi> who may Imploy Fifty Families or thereabouts; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Artificers they mention, as Bricklayers, Maſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being but very ſeldom Imployed, and that only in the Building and Repairing of their Kilnes, which are not Twenty in the whole, and the Profit thereof to the Perſons, ſo ſeldom Imployed, can be but very inconſiderable, and they but few in number; Whereas there are ſeveral hundreds of Families maintained in the Dealing and Retailing of Foreign and Inland Earthen Wares, whom this Bill, if it ſhould paſs, would utterly Ruin.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>That ſo great Quantities of Foreign Wares are now on divers Pretexts Imported, That unleſs a more effectual Prohibition be Eſtabliſhed, the Conſumption of the ſaid</hi> Engliſh <hi>Materials will ceaſe, the Poor be unimployed, and the ſaid Manufacture be totally loſt, and Foreigners thereby inabled to ſet what price they pleaſe on the ſaid Commodities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> That very little or no Foreign or Earthen Ware is Imported, which they do or can make here, but chiefly <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> Earthen Ware, and Melting Pots, (though ſome have had Patents for the ſole making Fine Earthen Wares here, after the manner of <hi>Holland,</hi> and have had all Encouragement imaginable from the ſaid Company of Glaſs Sellers and others, but could never make ſuch Ware or Tiles for Chimneys) and therefore cannot hinder the Conſumption of ſuch Earthen Ware as is made here; but the Importing of Foreign Earthen Ware has been a great Example to the very Pot-makers themſelves, by making their Wares after Foreign Patterns, to their great Intereſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerve.</hi> That if the ſaid Bill ſhould Paſs, it would be very prejudicial to the Nation in general for theſe Reaſons, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. It would give the ſaid Pot-Makers an Opportunity of ſetting what high Prizes they pleaſe on their Commodities, which they already threaten to do, in caſe the Bill ſhould Paſs, and have formerly done the ſame, upon the firſt putting out of the ſaid Proclamations.</item>
               <item>II. It will leſſen His Majeſties Cuſtoms, for moſt of the Materials of which the ſaid Commodities are made, are had from hence, and pay Cuſtom, both at the Exportation and Importation, and at the latter it pays Four ſhillings in the Pound by Act of Parliament.</item>
               <item>III. The ſaid Wares have been con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tantly Rated in the Book of Rates, and never Prohibited till by the firſt Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was Clandeſtinely obtained in the time of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Wars, and by vertue of that the Prizes of all Earthen Wares were here very much Enhanced.</item>
               <item>IV. It would be a great Prejudice to the Mint, and to all Silver Smiths, Chymiſts, and others, who uſe Crucibles and Melting Pots, the ſame being Imported from Abroad, and cannot be made here.</item>
               <item>V. It would hinder the Exporting of ſeveral Thouſand pounds a year of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodities which would never be Sold were it not in Barter for Foreign Earthen Ware.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> This Bill Prohibites the Importation of <hi>China,</hi> and all other curious Earthen Wares which can never be made here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which is humbly ſubmitted to this Honourable Houſe, and 'tis hoped for the Reaſons before mentioned, that the ſaid Bill will not be ſuffered to Paſs.</hi>
